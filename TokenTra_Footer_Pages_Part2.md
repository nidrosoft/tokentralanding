# About TokenTra

TokenTra is the AI cost intelligence platform that helps companies take control of their AI spending.

---

## Our Mission

**Make AI costs visible, predictable, and optimizable for every company.**

As AI becomes core infrastructure for modern businesses, costs are exploding with zero visibility. Companies spend hundreds of thousands on AI APIs without knowing which teams, projects, or features are driving the bill.

We're here to change that.

---

## The Problem We Solve

AI costs are the new cloud costs—growing faster than any other line item, spread across multiple providers, and completely opaque.

**The reality today:**
- Companies use 3-5 AI providers simultaneously (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS)
- Finance teams can't attribute costs to teams, projects, or features
- Developers write code with zero feedback on cost implications
- Nobody knows which prompts are wasteful or which models are overkill
- Bill shock hits at the end of every month

**What we do about it:**
TokenTra connects to all your AI providers and gives you a single dashboard with complete visibility. We show you where every dollar goes, alert you before budgets are exceeded, and use AI to find optimization opportunities you didn't know existed.

---

## What We Believe

### Visibility is the first step
You can't optimize what you can't see. That's why we start with complete, real-time visibility across every provider, model, team, and feature.

### AI should pay for itself
Every AI feature should have clear unit economics. If you don't know the cost per user or cost per transaction, you're flying blind.

### Developers need feedback loops
The person writing the code should know the cost implications. That's why we built our SDK to make cost attribution effortless.

### Optimization should be automatic
Finding savings shouldn't require a PhD in prompt engineering. Our AI analyzes your usage and surfaces actionable recommendations.

---

## Our Platform

TokenTra is built on four pillars:

**1. Unified Dashboard**
One place to see all AI spending—across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock.

**2. Cost Attribution**
Know exactly who's spending what. Track costs by team, project, feature, and user with our lightweight SDK.

**3. Budget Controls**
Set spending limits and get alerted before you exceed them—not after. Anomaly detection catches unusual patterns automatically.

**4. Optimization Engine**
AI-powered recommendations to reduce spend 10-30%. Smart routing sends queries to cost-efficient models. Semantic caching eliminates redundant calls.

---

## Our Customers

TokenTra is trusted by AI-native companies and enterprises who take cost management seriously:

# Why I Built TokenTra

*The story behind the AI cost intelligence platform*

---

Hi, I'm [Your Name], the founder of TokenTra.

I built TokenTra because I lived the problem it solves.

---

## The Wake-Up Call

It started with a $47,000 surprise.

I was leading engineering at an AI-native startup. We'd integrated GPT-4 into our product, customers loved it, and usage was growing fast. Life was good.

Then the invoice came.

Our AI bill had tripled in a single month. $47,000. No warning. No explanation. Just a number that made our CFO's eye twitch.

"What happened?" she asked.

I had no answer.

I spent the next two weeks digging through OpenAI's dashboard, cross-referencing with our application logs, building spreadsheets, and trying to figure out which feature, which team, which *anything* was responsible.

The answer? We didn't know. We couldn't know. The data simply didn't exist.

---

## The Search for Solutions

I looked for tools to help. Surely someone had solved this?

The options were... underwhelming.

- **Provider dashboards**: Siloed. OpenAI showed OpenAI. Anthropic showed Anthropic. No unified view.
- **LLM observability tools**: Focused on latency and debugging, not costs. Required invasive proxy setups.
- **Cloud cost tools**: Great for AWS and GCP, but clueless about AI APIs.
- **Spreadsheets**: What I ended up using. Hours of manual work every week.

Meanwhile, our AI spend kept climbing. $47K became $80K became $120K. And we still couldn't answer basic questions:

- Which feature costs the most?
- What's our cost per user?
- Are we using the right models for each task?
- Where's the waste?

---

## The Realization

I talked to other engineering leaders. The story was always the same:

*"Yeah, our AI costs are out of control."*
*"We have no idea where the money goes."*
*"Finance asks questions we can't answer."*
*"We're probably overspending, but we don't know where."*

This wasn't a me problem. It was an everyone problem.

And it was getting worse. Companies were adopting Claude alongside GPT-4. Gemini was entering the mix. Azure and AWS had their own AI services. The multi-provider future was here, and the visibility problem was compounding.

I realized: **the company that solves AI cost visibility will be as important to the AI era as Datadog was to the cloud era.**

---

## Building TokenTra

So I started building.

The vision was simple:
- **One dashboard** for all AI providers
- **Real attribution** to teams, projects, and features
- **Proactive alerts** before budgets blow up
- **AI-powered optimization** to find savings automatically

I wanted the tool I wished I'd had—something that would have saved me those two weeks of spreadsheet hell and prevented that $47K surprise.

The first version was ugly. It only supported OpenAI. It broke constantly.

But it worked. I could finally see where our AI money was going.

I showed it to a few friends at other companies. Their reaction: *"Can I use this? Please?"*

That's when I knew this needed to be a real product.

---

## Where We Are Now

TokenTra now supports all major AI providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock. Hundreds of teams use it to track millions in AI spend.

Our customers typically find 10-30% savings within the first month. Not because they were being wasteful, but because they finally had the visibility to optimize.

We've added features I once dreamed about:
- Smart routing that automatically sends simple queries to cheap models
- Semantic caching that eliminates redundant API calls
- Anomaly detection that catches runaway scripts before they become runaway bills
- Budget controls that actually work

But we're just getting started.

---

## What's Next

AI costs will only grow. Every company will become an AI company. The visibility problem will get worse before it gets better.

I'm building TokenTra to be the platform that solves this—for startups spending $10K/month and enterprises spending $10M/month.

If you're struggling with AI cost visibility, I'd love to help. That's literally why I built this.

## Implementation Notes

### For Cursor

1. Each page should be a Next.js page in the `app` directory
2. Use the same layout component as the main landing page
3. Use MDX or markdown rendering for long-form content
4. Add proper meta tags as specified
5. Include navigation back to main site
6. Footer should appear on all pages

### File Structure
